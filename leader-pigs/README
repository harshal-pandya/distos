This project is built and run with a tool called SBT. A ``sbt11`` script is provided in the root project directory.

The first time you run ``./sbt11`` it will will download the sbt jar.

To run our program simply ``./sbt11 "run 10 3"`` for 10 pigs and pig to map ratio of 3 (aka world size of 30). The first time all the dependencies will be downloaded which may take a couple minutes.
